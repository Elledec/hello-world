IT'S ME
===============
<b><br>Hello! My name is Elle Decker. </br></b>

### I currently live in Indiana and WFH for a company called Computershare. 
I'm incredibly excited to start this progam, as I used to enjoy tinkering around with computers and <i>lightly</i> writing some code. I dreamed of making a career out of it, but lost touch and became a little intimidated along the way. 

### I'm entertaining the idea of Data Analytics but Comp Programing also peaks my interest.
