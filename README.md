IT'S ME
===============
## Hello! My name is Elle Decker. 

### I currently live in Indiana and WFH for a company called Computershare. 
I'm incredibly excited to start this progam, as I used to enjoy tinkering around with computers and <i>lightly</i> writing some code. I dreamt of making a career out of it, but lost touch and became a little intimidated along the way.

### I'm entertaining the idea of Data Analytics but Computer Programing also peaks my interest.
