## A place to catch new ideas and build up future projects


IT'S ME
===============
<br>Hello! My name is Elle Decker. </br>

###I currently live in Indiana and WFH for a company called Computershare. 
I'm incredibly excited to start this progam, as I used to enjoy tinkering around with my computers and dreamed of making a career out of it, but lost touch and became a little intimidated along the way. 

####I'm entertaining the idea of Data Analytics but Comp Programing also peaks my interest.
